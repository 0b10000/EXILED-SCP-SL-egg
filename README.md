A pterodactyl egg for SCP:SL that has [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) support.

Features:

If you send a PR that only updates the [install script](https://github.com/Parkeymon/EXILED-SCP-SL-egg/blob/master/script.sh) don't send the exported egg just send the updated script.sh I will add it unless you need to make variable changes in the egg.
